# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries


### What I learned

I needed to use two different images for desktop and mobile, so I used display none and display block. This was the first time in this context. 

First time using the extension px -> rem, it is very useful indeed.
